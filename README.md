# Golang MongoDB REST

Simple Golang REST API with MongoDB

    /person         GET     - get the list of all persons
    /person         POST    - create one person
    /person/{id}    GET     - get one person by id
    /person/{id}    PATCH   - update one person by id
    /person/{id}    DELETE  - delete one person by id

Almost no error handling for the sake of simplicity.
